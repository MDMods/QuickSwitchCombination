# MuseDash-QuickSwitchCombination
Allow you to use shortcut key to switch your character and elfin.

[中文Readme](https://github.com/MDModsDev/QuickSwitchCombination/blob/master/README.zh.md)

## How to install
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) then put the QuickSwitchCombination.dll (You can download it [here](https://github.com/lxymahatma/MuseDash-QuickSwitchCombination/releases)) into the mods folder

## How to use
When you launch the game after putting the dll file into the mods folder, the mod will automatically generate a QuickSwitchCombination.cfg in the MuseDash\UserData folder

* The default reload key is F10
* The default menu key is F11 (still in developing)
* The first parameter is for shortcut key
* The second parameter is for character skill
* The third parameter is for elfin
### Example
If you want to use F12 as shortcut key and with little devil's skill, you should write like this:
[[datas]]
Key = "F12"
Character = "Little Devil"
Elfin = "Lilith"

(note: the lines with # are comments, you don’t need to care about it)

## Be careful about these things

* The language of parameters in txt file must follow your game setting language
* You can have multiple setting, just create a same style of setting after one is finished

## PS

This mod can be used at the same time with FavGirl coded by thegamemaster1234
