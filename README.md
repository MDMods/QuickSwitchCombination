[中文Readme](https://github.com/lxymahatma/MuseDash-QuickSwitchCombination/blob/main/README.zh.md)

## How to install
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) then put the QuickSwitchCombination.dll (You can download it [here](https://github.com/lxymahatma/MuseDash-QuickSwitchCombination/releases)) into the mods folder

## How to use
When you launch the game after putting the dll file into the mods folder, the mod will automatically generate a QuickSwitch.txt in the MuseDash folder
* The first parameter is for shortcut key
* The second parameter is for character skill
* The third parameter is for elfin
### Example
If you want to use F12 as shortcut key and control sleepwalker girl with little devil's skill, you should write like this:
F12,Little Devil,Lilith

## Be careful about these things

* The comma must be English comma
* The first line of the txt file cannot be deleted
* The language of parameters in txt file must follow your game setting language
* You can have multiple setting, just create a new line of setting after one is finished

## PS

This mod can be used at the same time with FavGirl coded by thegamemaster1234
